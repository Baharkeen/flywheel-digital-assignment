# Keyword Search Analysis

This project analyzes search engine data to determine how many searches the top-ranked keyword (rank 1) receives across different search engines. The data set includes keywords identified by their `keyword_id` and their respective search rankings.

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to explore and model the relationship between search engine type and the number of searches received by the most popular keyword. This involves statistical analysis and predictive modeling to answer the main question posed by the assignment.



This project is structured to deliver:
- Observations about the data.
- Descriptions of attempted methods and the rationale behind them.
- Visualizations used to understand the data.
- Models developed and their evaluations.
- Conclusions based on the analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the analysis, ensure the following libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels jupyter
